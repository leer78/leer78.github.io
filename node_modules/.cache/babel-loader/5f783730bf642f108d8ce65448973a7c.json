However, as I will mention later, I had to use PWM to control the fingers!</p>\r\n\r\n            <h5>Haptic Glove Part 1: Prototyping</h5>\r\n            <p>For the glove, I mostly settled on a design based on this Youtube series:  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yF-SJcg3zQ&ab_channel=LucasVRTech\" target='_blank'>LucidVR Haptic Gloves</a></p>\r\n            <p>As a very basic prototype to test the feasibility of this method, I just taped the badge reel to my fingers to mimick future usage.</p>\r\n            <p>While I did use the potentiometer + badge reel spring method from the video to measure finger displacement, I challenged myself to CAD it from scratch. This was quite fun as this was an instance of taking the time to really think about mechanical parts and how they come together to work as intended. For instance, the springs often bent at different points due to poor manufacturing, so I had to consider this in my design.</p>\r\n            <div className='ProjectImageContainer'>\r\n                <figure><img src='/images/RAimg5.jpg' alt=''/><figcaption>Badge Prototype</figcaption> </figure>\r\n                <figure><img src='/images/RAimg6.jpg' alt=''/><figcaption>Potentiometer + Reel</figcaption> </figure>\r\n                <figure><img src='/images/RAimg11.jpg' alt=''/><figcaption>Glove Assembly</figcaption> </figure>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <h5>Haptic Glove Part 2: Glove Assembly</h5>\r\n            <p>Once I had a decent system for measuring finger displacement, I had to assemble the rest of the glove. I used small rings at each finger joint to keep the reel in line, and found some velco straps at the dollar store which worked well for mounting the sensors to my hand.</p>\r\n            <h5>Haptic Glove Part 3: Coding + Control</h5>\r\n            <p>Using the same technique as what I used for the finger test rig, I mapped potentiometer values to angles of the servo. This allowed me to use a full range of motion to control the fingers precisely.</p>\r\n            <p>My first wired system read the glove readings directly into the Arduino Uno used for the robotic hand. This was easy to do as I was still able to use the built in servo control library. However, I decided to also make a wireless version using the LoRa radio system also featured in my portfolio. I used basic serial communication protocols where I sent packets of information related to each glove fingers position which would be replicated in the hand.</p>\r\n            <p>The biggest issue with this was that the Radiohead library actually had conflicts with the Servo.h library (low level register interference) which wasn't something I could really deal with. This meant that I had to implement my own method of controlling the servo motors! Using my understanding of Pulse Width Modulation from my courses, I was able to control the fingers without the library and still keep the wireless functionality.</p>\r\n            <p>To give the fingers a more realistic feel, I used a proportional controller of a PID. Based on distance between positions, I'd speed up the servos accordingly. Also, I noticed that the fingers were very finicky as the glove readings kept fluctuating on a small level. To comabt this, I used a threshold system where the glove output had to change by a specific amount in order for it to be reflected in the hand. While some precisionw as lost, it felt way more stable.</p>\r\n            <h4>Results</h4>\r\n            <p>Ultimately I ended up with a pretty cool robot hand system that I'm able to control from a distance. I was able to prototype, design, and print many parrts, and program using concepts like serial communication and PWM.</p>\r\n            <p>I'm very ambitious to start on an improved version. Possibilties include more precise control and a more functional arm (wrists and bicep).</p>\r\n            <div className='ProjectImageContainer'>\r\n                <figure><img src='/images/RAimg9.png' alt=''/><figcaption>Top Assembly View</figcaption> </figure>\r\n                <figure><img src='/images/RAimg10.png' alt=''/><figcaption>Back Assembly View</figcaption> </figure>\r\n                <figure><img src='images/robotArm.jpg' alt=''/><figcaption>Entire System</figcaption> </figure>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        </>\r\n    );\r\n};\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default RA;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
