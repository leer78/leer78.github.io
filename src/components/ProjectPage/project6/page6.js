            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>A digital circuit designed using finite state machines and logic gates to repetitvely output my student number. A full video can be found <a href ='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDECUQmE-Zg&feature=youtu.be'>here.</a></p>
            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>Use analytical logic and truth tables to develop Sum of Product/Product of Sum expressions for numbers, implement these using logic gates such as AND, OR, etc. and model this using Multisim as well as a physical build. </p>

                <figure><img src='/images/p6img5.png' alt=''/><figcaption>Final Physical Circuit</figcaption> </figure>
            </div>
            <h4>Implementation</h4>
            <p> To display my student number I first started by converting each value to binary as such: 4 = 100 – 0/x 0 = 000 - 0 0 = 000 - 1 3 = 011 - 0 1 = 001 – 0/x 2 = 010 - 0 2 = 010 - 1 = 011 - 1 5 = 101 – 0/x</p>
            <p>Using an excitation table and truth table, I then colour coded everything and made KMaps of each pin output. These expression outputs were then optimized based on recurring patterns and choosing between SOP/POS implementation.</p>
            <p>Using Multisim and knowledge of logic gates, I built the circuit using flipflops and decoder chips. To test, I then ran this through a timing diagram to ensure that the FSM followed the correct logic and loops properly.</p>
            <p>For the final physical build, I laid out the core pieces such as gates and LED. I then wired the clock for rising edges to each flipflop, and did the general wiring very carefully. I encountered a problem where my 7 segment display wasn't working, so I did a few tests on my own to ensure it was actually broken and not my negligence. I also faced other problems where the output wasn't what I expected. To solve this, I repetitvely followed wires in accordance to my simulation. However, I wasn't able to bug fix. Therefore, I had to redo the wires.</p>

            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>I was able to create an infinitely looping digital circuit using the built up principles of my Analog and Digital Circuits course. I furthered my understanding of gate theory and physically applied these concepts.</p>
